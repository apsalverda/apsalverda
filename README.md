Hi, I'm Anne Pier ("AP") ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist / data analyst with an extensive background in experimental research.

Each project below showcases different aspects of my data science, data analytics and programming skills.

### Personal projects

#### [warbler-songs-quiz-python](https://github.com/apsalverda/warbler-songs-quiz-python)
A lightweight Python app to learn to recognize birds by ear.

#### [ebird-dashboard-hotspot-R](https://github.com/apsalverda/ebird-dashboard-hotspot-R)
A dynamic dashboard, created in Quartio/R/Shiny, to explore your personal eBird data.

#### [ebird-report-user-data-R](https://github.com/apsalverda/ebird-report-user-data-R)
A dynamic report, created in Quario, based on your personal eBird data.

ðŸª¶ Why are all these projects focused on bird data? I started birding a couple of years ago and got hooked. I created the quiz, dashboard and report below to improve my birding skills and to support my birding activities. I hope that they will be useful for other birders.
