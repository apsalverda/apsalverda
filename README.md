Hi, I'm Anne Pier ("AP") üëã

I'm a data scientist / data analyst with a background in cognitive science.

Each project below showcases different aspects of my data science, data analysis, data visualization, and programming skills.

### Personal projects

#### [ebird-dashboard-hotspot-R](https://github.com/apsalverda/ebird-dashboard-hotspot-R)
A dynamic dashboard, created in Quarto/R/Shiny, to explore your personal eBird data.

#### [ebird-report-user-data-R](https://github.com/apsalverda/ebird-report-user-data-R)
A dynamic report, created in Quarto/R, based on your personal eBird data.

#### [birdsong-quiz-python](https://github.com/apsalverda/birdsong-quiz-python)
A lightweight Python app to learn to identify birds by their songs and calls.

üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ Why are many of my personal projects focused on bird data? I started birding a couple of years ago and got hooked. I created the quiz, dashboard and dynamic report above, as well as the menu bar tool below, to support my birding activities and to improve my birding skills. I share the source code here in hope that some projects may be be useful for other birders.

### Tools

#### [assets-checker-python](https://github.com/apsalverda/assets-checker-python)
A simple tool to identify missing assets in content JSON.

#### [ebird-hotspot-menu-bar-python](https://github.com/apsalverda/ebird-hotspot-menu-bar-python)
A small app that displays a list of recent observations for a particular eBird hotspot, with live data from the eBird API.
